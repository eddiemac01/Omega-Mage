Omega Mage Final
Did the Omega Mage project for my Final. After going as far as Gibson goes in the book, I took it a little further. 
I added three other elemental spells, Air, Water, and Earth.
Air Spell slows enemies,
Water Spell deals small damage, but also gives temporary speed boost to player
Earth Spell heals the player, but will also heal enemies that walk over it.

Also added intro screen that somewhat explains how the game works.
